# 🐍 30-Day Python Coding Challenge

Welcome to my repository!  
I am documenting my journey from absolute beginner to Python developer over 30 days through daily coding, projects, and consistency.

🎯 Goal: Build a strong programming foundation in Python (logic, data structures, problem solving).

## 🚀 Daily Breakdown

---

## Day 1: Health Tracker Forecast

A forecasting tool that predicts physical progress based on user activity.

### 🔹 Features
- Input validation using loops
- Conditional intensity classification
- Forecast output

### 🧠 Key Learning
Implemented strong **input validation** using `while True` loops.

---

## Day 2: Number Analyzer Tool

Analyzes a number and extracts multiple mathematical properties.

### 🔹 Features
- Prints numbers up to N
- Calculates sum
- Counts even/odd numbers
- Computes factorial
- Detects prime numbers

### 🧠 Key Learning
Worked with **nested loops** and Python's `for-else` construct.

---

## Day 3: Student Marks Analyzer

Analyzes student marks and produces grade distribution.

### 🔹 Features
- Stores marks dynamically
- Finds highest & lowest marks
- Assigns grades (A–F)
- Counts pass/fail students
- Displays tabular output

### 🧠 Key Learning
Mastered **list manipulation** and dynamic data storage.

---

## Day 4: Personal Finance Tracker

Tracks income, expenses, and balance using functions.

### 🔹 Features
- Add income and expenses
- Categorized expense tracking
- Real-time balance calculation
- Menu-driven interface

### 🧠 Key Learning
Introduction to **modular programming using functions** and global variables.

---

## Day 5: Student Record Manager

A full CRUD system for managing student data using dictionaries.

### 🔹 Features
- Add student records
- View all records
- Update marks
- Delete students
- Find topper

### 🧠 Key Learning
Mastered **dictionary operations**, key-value storage, and membership testing.

---

## Day 6: Utility Functions Suite

A collection of reusable functions solving common programming tasks.

### 🔹 Features
- Greeting function
- Even/Odd checker
- Largest number finder
- Calculator operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Factorial function
- Prime checker
- Grade calculator
- List analyzer

### 🧠 Key Learning
Deep understanding of:

- Function definition and calling
- Parameters and return values
- Code modularization
- Reusability
- Separation of concerns

---

## Day 8: Unique Visitor Tracker

Tracks website visitors across multiple days using sets.

### 🔹 Features
- Store visitor IDs for different days
- Count total unique visitors
- Find common visitors between days
- Menu-driven interface
- Prevents duplicates automatically

### 🧠 Key Learning

Mastered **Set operations**:

- Union → all unique visitors
- Intersection → common visitors
- Fast duplicate removal
- Real-world data modeling
