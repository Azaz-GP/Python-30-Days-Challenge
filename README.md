# 🚀 Daily Breakdown

---

## Day 1 — Health Tracker Forecast

A tool that predicts physical progress based on user activity.

### 🔹 Features

- Strong input validation using `while True`
- Conditional intensity classification
- Forecast-based output logic

### 🧠 Key Learning

Developed structured **input validation techniques** and conditional logic control.

---

## Day 2 — Number Analyzer Tool

Analyzes a number and extracts multiple mathematical properties.

### 🔹 Features

- Print numbers up to N
- Calculate sum
- Count even/odd numbers
- Compute factorial
- Detect prime numbers

### 🧠 Key Learning

Practiced **nested loops**, logical conditions, and Python’s `for-else` structure.

---

## Day 3 — Student Marks Analyzer

Processes student marks and generates grade distribution.

### 🔹 Features

- Dynamic data storage using lists
- Highest and lowest mark detection
- Grade assignment (A–F)
- Pass/fail statistics
- Tabular output formatting

### 🧠 Key Learning

Mastered **list manipulation**, iteration patterns, and dynamic data collection.

---

## Day 4 — Personal Finance Tracker

Tracks income, expenses, and real-time balance using modular functions.

### 🔹 Features

- Add income and expenses
- Categorized expense tracking
- Real-time balance calculation
- Menu-driven interface

### 🧠 Key Learning

Introduced **modular programming**, function design, and scope management.

---

## Day 5 — Student Record Manager

A full CRUD system for managing student data using dictionaries.

### 🔹 Features

- Add student records
- View all records
- Update marks
- Delete records
- Identify topper

### 🧠 Key Learning

Strengthened **dictionary operations**, key-value management, and data mutation patterns.

---

## Day 6 — Unique Visitor Tracker

Tracks website visitors across multiple days using sets.

### 🔹 Features

- Store visitor IDs per day
- Count total unique visitors
- Identify returning visitors
- Menu-driven interface
- Automatic duplicate prevention

### 🧠 Key Learning

Applied **set theory concepts**:

- Union → all unique visitors  
- Intersection → returning visitors  
- Fast duplicate elimination  

---

## Day 7 — Personal Notes Saver

A persistent note-taking application using file handling.

### 🔹 Features

- Save notes permanently to `notes.txt`
- Append mode to prevent overwriting
